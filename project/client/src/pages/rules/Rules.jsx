          <p className="card-text">
          This Act prohibits the giving or taking of dowry, which is a common practice
    in some parts of India. The Act provides for punishment for those who give
    or take dowry. The dowry system in India refers to the durable goods, cash,
    and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the groom, his
    parents and his relatives as a condition of the marriage. The dowry system
    can put great financial burden on the bride's family. In some cases, the
    dowry system leads to crime against women, ranging from emotional abuse and
    injury to even deaths. The payment of dowry has long been prohibited under
    specific Indian laws including the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 approved by
    the Parliament of India and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498A of the
    Indian Penal Code.
